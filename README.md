## Instructions

To get started, CSS 3D DICE CUBE, We can just make a cube and add a border radius to the sides. I guess this would do if you can live with the fact that it looks really crappy since the cube is not solid.

CSS cubes really showcase what CSS has become over the years, evolving from simple color and dimension directives to a language capable of creating deep, creative visuals. Add animation and you've got something really neat.

.dice{
	position:relative;
	margin:0 auto;
	height: 400px;
	width: 1000px;  /*sping around the width area. for stop make width 400px, must match with height*/
	transform-style:preserve-3d;
	animation: spin 9s infinite alternate;
}
